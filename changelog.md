# Changelog

This changelog is started retroactively with version 1.1.0 in order to track further (major progress). It is not meant to give detailed instructions on the development of this repository. Rather, the goal is to get an overview of change. For specifics, you may read the (may or may not) helpful commit messages and investigate their changes.


# 1.1.0

This version is meant as a backup point. This tag was set in order to keep a baseline from before the refactor of today (15.12.2023).



# 2.0.0 : The great unification (sorta)

The `math.sty` file has been revised to follow a more unified approach for defining macros.
